            <h2>Mann Mera Original by Gajendra Verma</h2>
            <p>
                Some songs don't just speak of love, they *feel* like love. Such songs stand the test of time, transcend boundaries and create an impact for generations to come. <br>
                “Mann Mera” by Gajendra Verma is one such song. Originally created back in 2012 and re-worked as part of a film (“Table No. 21”), the song has earned its place as a modern classic in the world of Hindi love songs.
