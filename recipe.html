  <h1>The DOSA Recipe</h1>
  <p>
Dosa is a popular South Indian dish that has become a beloved staple across India and around the world. Known for its crispy texture and savory flavor, dosa is a thin, crepe-like pancake made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram lentils). It's often served with a variety of accompaniments like coconut chutney, sambar (a spiced lentil soup), and potato masala.
The magic of dosa lies in its fermentation process, which gives it a slightly tangy taste and a light, airy texture. Whether enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, dosa is a versatile dish that can be customized with different fillings or enjoyed plain.
In this recipe, you'll learn how to make traditional dosa from scratch—perfect for both beginners and seasoned cooks looking to recreate this delicious South Indian favorite at home.

<h2>Ingrideints</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rice – 2 cups (preferably parboiled rice or dosa rice)</li>
  <li>Urad dal (split black gram) – ½ cup</li>
  <li>Fenugreek seeds (methi) – ½ teaspoon (optional, helps with fermentation and flavor)</li>
  <li>Water – as needed (for soaking, grinding, and adjusting batter consistency)</li>
  <li>Salt – to taste (usually added after fermentation)</li>
  <li>Oil or ghee (clarified butter) – for greasing the pan and drizzling over the dosa</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Soaking:</strong>
Rinse and soak urad dal and fenugreek seeds together in water for at least 4–6 hours.

Rinse and soak rice (and poha, if using) separately for 4–6 hours.

<li><strong>Grinding:</strong>
Grind the urad dal mixture to a smooth, fluffy batter using minimal water.
Grind the rice (and poha) to a slightly coarse batter.
Mix both batters together in a large bowl. The consistency should be pourable but not watery.
</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation:</strong>
Add salt and mix well.
Cover and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8–12 hours or overnight, until it rises and becomes slightly bubbly.</li>
<li><strong>Making Dosas:</strong>
Stir the fermented batter gently (don't overmix).

Heat a non-stick or cast-iron dosa tawa (griddle) until hot.

Lightly grease it and pour a ladleful of batter in the center.

Spread it in a circular motion to make a thin crepe.

Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges.

Cook on medium-high heat until golden and crispy.

Fold and serve hot. (You can flip if you like it cooked on both sides.)
